1. How bad is churn, really?

Overall churn rate: ~56.7%

That’s critically high. At this level:

Growth is mostly replacing lost customers

CAC efficiency collapses

Pricing power erodes

Support load keeps rising (which further fuels churn)

This business is currently in a leaky bucket phase.


2. What are the strongest churn drivers?

Ranked by impact (correlation + business logic):

 2.1. Support Calls (Strongest driver)

Highest positive correlation with churn

More support calls = much higher churn probability

Strategic meaning

This is not a retention issue — it’s a product / service quality issue

Customers don’t churn silently; they churn after repeated friction
Reducing support calls will reduce churn faster than discounts or loyalty programs.

 2.2. Payment Delays

Customers with frequent payment delays churn more

Strategic meaning

Indicates:

Billing friction

Trust issues

Low perceived value

These customers are already “mentally churned”

Payment delay is an early warning signal, not the root cause.


2.3. Contract Length (Structural churn)

Monthly plans: ~100% churn

Annual / Quarterly: ~46%

Strategic meaning

Monthly plans are effectively a trial, not a subscription

You are over-exposed to low-commitment customers

 This is a pricing & packaging problem, not marketing.

 2.4. Total Spend (Protective factor)

Higher lifetime spend → significantly lower churn

Strategic meaning

High-value customers stay

Low-value customers bleed out

Retention ROI is highest when focused on top-spending cohorts, not averages.

Q3) What doesn’t drive churn (important!)

These are not major levers:

Usage Frequency (weak effect)

Tenure (slightly protective but weak)

Gender (no strategic relevance)

 Churn is not because customers “don’t use it enough”.
It’s because when they do, it creates problems.

4. Subscription strategy insights:
Subscription Type

Basic, Standard, Premium all churn ~56–58%

Strategic meaning

Tiering isn’t solving different needs

Likely feature bundling ≠ customer pain points
Differentiation is cosmetic, not functional.

5. Churn risk segmentation (actionable)

You can classify customers into 3 buckets:

-High-Risk (Immediate intervention)

Monthly contract

High support calls

Payment delays

Low total spend

 Don’t discount these blindly — fix experience or let them go

-Medium-Risk (Saveable)

Quarterly / Annual

Moderate support calls

Mid spend

Best ROI segment for:

Proactive support

Feature education

Contract upgrades

-Low-Risk (Protect at all costs)

High total spend

Low support calls

Longer contracts

Build white-glove retention, not mass campaigns.

6. Strategic recommendations (prioritized)
1️⃣ Fix the churn source, not symptoms

Audit top 5 reasons for support calls

Eliminate repeat issues at product/process level

Every unresolved support issue compounds churn.

2️⃣ Kill or redesign Monthly plans

Options:

Price monthly significantly higher

Convert to “starter” with strict limits

Incentivize Quarterly as default

3️⃣ Use payment delay as churn trigger

Auto-flag customers after X delayed payments

Trigger:

Outreach

Plan adjustment

Support check-in

4️⃣ Shift retention spend to high-value users

Stop treating all churn equally

Protect revenue, not logos

Recommended Pricing + Contract Restructuring Plan:

Objective: Structurally reduce churn from ~57% → <30% in 6–9 months
Principle: Remove low-commitment, high-friction customers by design, not by force.

-Eliminate “true” Monthly plans which are currently:

100% churn, Support-heavy, Low LTV, Operationally expensive
-Replace with a 3-layer contract system to Filter serious customers. So No auto-renew unless upgraded.
-Introduce Quarterly default checkout option 10–15% cheaper than Starter (per month) so there is Enough commitment to justify onboarding investment
and Psychological “trial + commitment” balance.
- Throw in Retention Focussed Annual Plan framed as best value and comes with: Priority support

Fewer friction points

Optional onboarding call

This way Customers feel “chosen,” not trapped.

Example Pricing Structure:
| Plan    | Contract  | Price Logic        | Support  |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Starter | 30 days   | Highest per-unit   | Limited  |
| Core    | Quarterly | –10–15% vs Starter | Standard |
| Plus    | Annual    | –20–30% vs Starter | Priority |

Support-based soft pressure

Starter: limited support interactions

Core: normal support

Plus: priority + proactive

Result:
Customers who need more help naturally upgrade instead of churning.
